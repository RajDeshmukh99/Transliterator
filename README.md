# Transliterator

A normal person expresses 11000â€“25000 words every day making speech the most well-known method for conveying everything that needs to be conveyed. Be it a discussion, discourse, speech, introductions or any broad talks, we use speech to express contemplations and activities. In a situation where both sides are ignorant of the language used in the exchange, the cycle will be irrelevant. Consequently we need a framework that can connect this language boundary. Speech to speech translation is one such framework that can prove to be useful by facilitating the chat between people communicating in various dialects.
Google has its own algorithm that uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to facilitate machine translation using Neural Machine Translation (NMT), called GNMT (Google NMT). Now, Recursive Neural Network (RNN) can model sequence of data, like time series, so that each sample can be assumed to be dependent on the previous ones, unlike Artificial Neural Network. Also, RNN can even be used with convolutional layers to extend the effective pixel neighborhood. Thus, RNN is preferred comparatively more these days.
